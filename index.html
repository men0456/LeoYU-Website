        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I have little professional expereinces in for IT solutions. All expereinces are informal but I believe that these experience are valubale.<br><br>

        I am aware of hardware functionality. I am profecient in Windows and Linux servers. I developed my own linux storage server. I am working to get linux certifaction. I am able to perform maintence on office machines and verify that they are still capable for professional work. I am flexible to be able to work remotely I have performed remote maintence and will only be done for only up to 24 hours since the reported incident. <br><br>

        One incident that showed my professionalism is when my mother ran into a virus. I knew our network could be compromised. I quarantine the affected computer and was able to deal with the virus by removing the affected files. A copy of the  files were stored offsite at on my friends server so no real damage was dealt. After the incident I purposely went through all of my passwords and reset them. This ranged from my email passwords to resetting our wifiâ€™s password. As a extra security measure we then changed our IP address on our router to ensure this type of attack would be more diffcult to be repeated.<br><br>
        
        Other professional activites was that I am developed programs in JAVA. This programs were just modfication of exsiting programs that I had before and I wanted a personalized setting. I further developed visuals adjustment mods for a color blinded firend. These modfication took me a month to develop but was fully troubleshooted.I posted the mod on github as a open source downloadable file and is used by people on the web. <br><br>
        
        Additonally, I have had professional experience in using coding programs like Java and Python. I developed a bot Java that was able to learn and function as a mini boss in the popular game Minecraft.<br><br>
        
        My actual professional expereince would be that of a business student. I am hardworking and have flexible to work with many different types of people. On one project we had to present our finace for a product. I took task of creating our finace. For 3 days worked and reworked my groups finacl statements. My group was grateful for my deeds and we were able to present on time and with correct information.<br><br>
        
        Another professional expereince taht I have is volenteering at my local libary. It was a small space that was held as a important place. I worked there for 1 year and it was a year where I value. I grew the most when I was working that place. I learned the most about who I was and I learned that I was a type of person to work a certain way. Some basic task would be sorting books and making props for events. Many times I would notice that many books were not properly filed and infact was wrong. This was a rampant occurance and was very discouranging. I would force myself to reorganize the misplaced books and try to get them all organized. I was rewarded with the staff never having a issue find books for customers and they were thankful for my inistion.
